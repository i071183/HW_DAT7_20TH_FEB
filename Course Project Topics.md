# First Project : Weather vs Stock Market Performance

When we talked about course projects , my inital project plan was to compare the weather data in Australia vs the Stock Market performance to see if the weather had an impact on the stock movement for the day . This is due to the fact that the weather was lousy that day and i felt like seeing if the depressing weather made an impact on the number of buy/sells that day on the ASX . 

I found this site http://www.asxhistoricaldata.com/ which has a lot of the historical stock market data . I do need to find out how to get historical Sydney weather data for the last 10 years .

I plan on using the two datasets to find a coorelation between the stock movements and the weather . Not sure yet on the methodology i plan to use to compare the two datasets. 
 
 
# Analysis of NSW Rental Data
 
 I came accoross this data set http://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/4e51f1d3-4b72-48b8-96ef-8493b7aa9c37/resource/ca5c4a11-64f8-4583-91c9-d9436d38e2e9/download/FA13-2016-17.XLSX
 which i find very interesting . It contains the rental data for all properties rented out in Sydney from 2013 to 2016 with these datapoints 
 
 DateTenancyCommenced	DateLodgement	BondAmount	PremisesWeeklyRent	PremisesDwellingType	NumberBedrooms	Premises_Postcode	Premises_Suburb
 
 I want to use this data to plot the increase in rents per suburb since 2013 which i then want to place onto an interactive map to give users the ability to view the increase or decrease in rents over a period of time .
