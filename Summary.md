The important role of Data Scientists is to interpret and communicate Data.
[Hillary Mason] highlights the significance of Data scientists and relevance in Organisations. Five years ago, Data Science barely existed but has evolved rapidly. The facts that Data scientists have emerged from various academic backgrounds, Data companies that have invested in building a strong/ mature base infrastructure and the Culture that Data science is not exclusive to Mathematicians/ Statisticians.

Data Science is beyond just asking the questions and gathering data to answer it. It is a process of storytelling technical and complicated analytical data to people who donâ€™t understand the complexities.Acquiring these skills requires experience, practice and valuable data sets. Large companies have incompatible databases or reluctant in sharing their data. So, Hilary recommends acquiring these skills at Startups where their products are generating their own data. The culture enables flexibility with the right comfort and social environment. After obtaining a good data set, it is important to first, define the question of the data set. Secondly, how will I know when its done. Thirdly, what would you do with the result once solved (assuming) perfectly.

Data Scientists are people who are creative, flexible and grow with the product The work of Data scientists are divided into three buckets: Stats, Code and Storytelling/ Visualisation. By attempting projects, Data Scientists can play to their strengths and build their capability with every data set.
